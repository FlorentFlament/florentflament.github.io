Title: Chef Server on Raspberry Pi

Tags: Chef, Raspberry Pi, Raspbian

[Raspberry Pi][4] devices are cheap, quiet, and powerful enough to run
a Debian based Linux Operating System called [Raspbian][5]. Such
device would be very convenient to manage one's personal
infrastructure, composed of some physical and / or virtual machines,
by running Chef Server.

While, the official Chef website mostly documents [the installation of
Chef Server on Ubuntu and (Red Hat) Enterprise Linux][1], Chef Server
is available through its API and already packaged for Raspbian as
package `chef-server-api`.

The installation of Chef Server on a Raspberry Pi is therefore quite
forward. The steps to follow, that are described below, are somehow
inspired from these [instructions to have Chef Server installed on
Debian using binary packages][2].

Installation procedure
----------------------

* Start from a fresh installation of Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. From
NOOBS menu, install Raspbian (Using NOOBS v1.2.1).

* Install Chef Server binary package:

        ::::bash
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install chef-server-api

* Configure Chef Server, by answering to the two questions that will
  be asked:

    * URL of Chef server: http://CHEF_SERVER_IP:4000
    * Chef AMQP user password: RANDOM_PASSWORD (Avoid using special
      characters)

Note: Some services won't start, like jetty. `chef-server` will also
be said to have failed, but Chef Server APIs will be working anyway.

* Testing:

        ::::text
        root@raspberrypi:~# knife configure -i
        WARNING: No knife configuration file found
        Where should I put the config file? [/root/.chef/knife.rb]
